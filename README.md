# eth_pic32
An ethernet MAC and PHY layer for PIC32.

The demo application just sends a frame with a fixed message. 
ATTENTION: set MAC address of your PC as destination MAC address and check the sent frame with a tool like Wireshark.

For an example of use please have a look at minUDP or minIP projects.
